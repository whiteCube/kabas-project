# Kabas

**A flexible CMS**

Ever wanted a light, simple yet flexible Content Management System? That's exactly what we're trying to build here. Based on the ideas behind Laravel and some of its components, Kabas is already deployed on a few websites and will be published as an Open-Source Project as soon as we'll reach a completely stable version. Stay tuned !

> **Note:** this repository only contains the files needed to start a Kabas project. Core files are installed using composer.
